## Overview

This project implements an end-to-end trading system with two main components:
1. LSTM-based price prediction model
2. Automated trading simulation environment

### Key Features
- Real-time data fetching from TradingView
- Deep learning price prediction using LSTM
- Simulated trading environment with market hours
- Comprehensive position and risk management
- Performance visualization and analysis

## System Architecture

### Dependencies
```python
tensorflow>=2.7.0
pandas>=1.3.0
numpy>=1.19.5
matplotlib>=3.4.3
scikit-learn>=0.24.2
tvDatafeed>=2.0.0
talib-binary>=0.4.19
```

### Data Flow
1. Data Collection → TradingView API
2. Preprocessing → Sequence Creation
3. Prediction → LSTM Model
4. Trading Decision → Strategy Implementation
5. Execution → MockBroker
6. Analysis → Performance Metrics

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nifty-trading-system.git
cd nifty-trading-system

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up data collection
# Configure TradingView credentials in config.py
```

## Components

### 1. Data Collection and Processing
```python
from tvDatafeed import TvDatafeed, Interval

# Initialize data feed
tv = TvDatafeed()
data = tv.get_hist(
    symbol="NIFTY",
    exchange="NSE",
    interval=Interval.in_5_minute,
    n_bars=3000
)
```

### 2. LSTM Model Architecture
```python
model = Sequential([
    LSTM(50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(SEQ_LENGTH, 1)),
    LSTM(50),
    Dense(1)
])
```

### 3. MockBroker Trading System
```python
class MockBroker:
    """
    Simulates trading environment with:
    - Portfolio management
    - Risk controls
    - Market hour restrictions
    """
```

## Usage

### 1. Data Collection
```python
# Fetch and prepare data
data = pd.read_csv('stock_data.csv', parse_dates=True)
data['datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(data['datetime'])
price_data = data.tail(500)
```

### 2. Model Training
```python
# Prepare sequences
X, y = create_sequences(prices_scaled, SEQ_LENGTH)

# Train model
history = model.fit(
    X_train, y_train,
    epochs=20,
    batch_size=32,
    validation_data=(X_test, y_test)
)
```

### 3. Trading Simulation
```python
# Initialize broker
broker = MockBroker(
    balance=100000,
    price=stock_prices,
    trading_start=time(9, 15),
    trading_end=time(15, 30)
)

# Trading loop
for i in range(30, len(price_data)):
    if not broker.trade_intraday(i, current_time):
        continue
        
    predicted_price = predict_next_day_price(model, recent_prices)
    
    # Execute trades based on strategy
    if predicted_price > current_price * 1.001:
        broker.buy('nifty50', current_price, qty=10)
    elif predicted_price < current_price * 0.999:
        broker.sell('nifty50', current_price, qty=10)
```

## Trading Strategy

### Entry Conditions
1. Long Entry (Buy):
   - Predicted price > Current price * 1.001

2. Short Entry (Sell):
   - Predicted price < Current price * 0.999

### Risk Management
1. Position Sizing:
   - Fixed quantity: 10 units per trade

2. Trading Hours:
   - Start: 9:15 AM
   - End: 3:30 PM

3. Auto Square-off:
   - End of day position closure
   - Trading hour restrictions

## Performance Analysis

### Metrics Calculation
```python
# Calculate returns
initial_balance = 100000
final_net_worth = broker.networth[-1]
returns = ((final_net_worth - initial_balance) / initial_balance) * 100
```

### Visualization
```python
# Plot performance
plt.plot(broker.networth, label="Net Worth")
plt.title("Net Worth Over Time")
plt.xlabel("Trading Intervals")
plt.ylabel("Portfolio Value")
plt.legend()
```

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Model Improvements
- Feature engineering with technical indicators
- Multiple timeframe analysis
- Ensemble methods

### 2. Trading System
- Dynamic position sizing
- Advanced order types
- Stop-loss implementation
- Multiple asset support

### 3. Risk Management
- Portfolio optimization
- Volatility-based sizing
- Correlation analysis
